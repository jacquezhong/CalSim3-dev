 Once the DI value is estimated, a contract year based delivery target is determined
 by splitting the DI estimate into Delivery target and estimated Carryover values.

 A delivery target is set in March and can be increased (but NOT decreased) in
 April and May.  Delivery targets in June through the next February will be equal
 to the value used in the previous May.
